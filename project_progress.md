# Codexpilot Extension - Progress Summary

## What We've Built So Far

### Basic Extension Structure
- Created a VS Code extension with TypeScript
- Set up the extension manifest (package.json) with proper configuration
- Added an icon in the activity bar (rocket icon)
- Configured the extension to activate when the view is opened

### User Interface
- Created a webview-based UI with three main sections:
  1. **Context Files Section**: A small area at the top to display files added to the context
  2. **Chat History Section**: The main area that displays the conversation between the user and the AI
  3. **Input Area**: A text input and send button at the bottom for user messages

### Visual Styling
- Applied CSS styling to make the UI look good and match VS Code's theme
- Used VS Code theme variables for better integration with different themes
- Created styles for user and assistant messages with different colors and alignment
- Made the chat area scrollable to handle long conversations

### Basic Functionality
- Set up event listeners for the send button and Enter key
- Created functions to add messages to the chat
- Added state management to persist chat history between sessions
- Implemented a welcome message for first-time users

### Communication Framework
- Set up the communication channel between the webview and the extension host
- Created message handlers for different types of messages
- Prepared the structure for sending user messages to an AI service (to be implemented)

## What's Next

1. **Context Management**:
   - Implement commands to add files to the context
   - Create functionality to display and manage context files

2. **AI Integration**:
   - Connect to an AI service (like OpenAI or Google's Gemini)
   - Send user messages with context to the AI
   - Process and display AI responses

3. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Add markdown rendering for code blocks
   - Implement syntax highlighting
   - Add buttons to apply code suggestions directly

4. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Add loading indicators
   - Implement error handling
   - Add settings for customization

## Current Status
The extension has a working UI framework but doesn't yet connect to an AI service. Users can type messages and see them in the chat, but there's no AI response yet.
